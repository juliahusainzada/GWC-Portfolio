        "* Pandas is a powerful Python library for data manipulation and analysis\n",
        "* It provides easy-to-use data structures and functions to work with structured data, primarily in the form of tables (dataframes)\n",
        "\n",
        "### Why use Pandas for Data Analysis?\n",
        "1. **Ease of Use**: Simplifies common tasks like loading, cleaning, transforming, and analyzing data.\n",
        "2. **Flexible Data Structures**: Offers Series (1D) and DataFrame (2D) for easy data handling.\n",
        "3. **Integration with Other Libraries**: Works seamlessly with Matplotlib, Seaborn, and more.\n",
        "4. **Rich Functionality**: Provides functions for filtering, grouping, merging, reshaping, and statistical analysis.\n",
        "5. **Community Support**: Large community with plenty of resources for learning and troubleshooting.\n",
        "\n",
        ">****[Here's](https://images.datacamp.com/image/upload/v1676302204/Marketing/Blog/Pandas_Cheat_Sheet.pdf) a Pandas resource chart that you can refer to during the workshop.****\n",

        "### Loading a Library\n",

        "2. Directly import Pandas into your Python code using the import statement:\n",
        "\n",
        "  ``` import [library name] as [alias]```\n",
